# Predictive_analytics_for_business
This repo contains all the projects I submitted during the Predictive_analytics_for_business
NanoDegree scholarship at Udacity.

Here I gave a step by step walkthrough on how I tackled each project, project reviews and
corrections made to each project as suggested by the reviewer.

## The projects in this repo are listed below:
1. Predicting Catalog Demand: In this project, I analyzed a business problem in the mail-order catalog business. I predicting how much money a company that I worked for can expect to earn from sending out a catalog to new customers. The business problem was solved using multiple linear regression machine learning model.
2. Creating Analytical Dataset: In this project, blended from different sources, formatted the data and took care of outliers then used cleaned up dataset to create another linear regression model. The difference this time is that you will have to choose which variable(s) are the most important for the model using new techniques learned in the Selecting Predictor Variables section.
3. Predicting default risk: As a loan officer at a young and small bank (been in operations for two years) that needs to come up with an efficient solution to classify new customers on whether they can be approved for a loan or not. I built a series of classification (logistic regression, decision tree, forest and boosted tree) models to figure out the best model and then provided a list of creditworthy customers to my manager.
4. A/B testing: I was a business analyst for Round Roasters, a coffee restaurant in the United States of America. The executive team conducted a market test with a new menu (gourmet sandwiches and limited wine offerings) and needs to figure whether the new menu can drive enough sales to offset the cost of marketing the new menu. I analyzed the A/B test and from the result of the analysis, I wrote a recommendation to Round Roasters to launch the new menu.
