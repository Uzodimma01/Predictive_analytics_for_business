# Predictive_analytics_for_business
This repo contains all the projects I submitted during the Predictive_analytics_for_business
NanoDegree scholarship at Udacity.

Here I gave a step by step walkthrough on how I tackled each project, project reviews and
corrections made to each project as suggested by the reviewer.

There are 7 projects in this NanoDegree as listed below:
1. Diamond price prediction
2. Predicting Catalog Demand
3. Creating Analytical Dataset
